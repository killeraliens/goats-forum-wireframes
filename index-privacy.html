          <h1>Privacy</h1>
          <p>Your personal account information
          will never be shared, but the things you post on here may be.</p>
          <p>Some of the data obtained by this website will
          eventually be made accessablie to other developers
          as an API resource. This means something you post
          (like a venue or flyer) may be used for future alternative
          apps and front-facing websites (with our approval).
          </p>
          <p>We are working on getting forum account holders more
          control on what other members may see, but for now,
          everything you post here will be public to other members.
          </p>
          <p>We want better tools for you, the bands, fans, and people putting on the shows. Public event data is currently owned by
          monopolies like Facebook and has never been more difficult to gain access to from a developers standpoint. This forum
          intends to build an independant data resource for the events we want more of.</p>
